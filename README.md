# CatoMata 🐾  

**Welcome to CatoMata** – A playful yet educational app for understanding core concepts in automata theory! Inspired by the curiosity and elegance of cats, this app brings the complex world of computational models to life with interactive animations.  

---

## 🌟 Features  

Explore the fascinating world of automata theory with these modules, each equipped with engaging animations:  

1. **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**  
   Visualize state transitions in a deterministic system where every input leads to a unique state.  

2. **Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**  
   Witness how multiple paths can coexist for a single input, demonstrating nondeterministic behavior.  

3. **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**  
   Learn the foundation of programming languages by watching grammar rules transform into parse trees.  

4. **Push Down Automata (PDA)**  
   Understand how a stack enhances the capabilities of finite automata through real-time simulations.  

5. **Turing Machine**  
   Experience the power of computation with an interactive animation that shows how Turing Machines process data.  

6. **Tower of Hanoi**  
   Take a break from theory and solve this classic puzzle using recursive logic!
