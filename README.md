## 🌟 Features  

Explore the fascinating world of automata theory with these modules, each equipped with engaging animations:  

### 1. Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)  
Visualize state transitions in a deterministic system where every input leads to a unique state.

### 2. Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)  
Witness how multiple paths can coexist for a single input, demonstrating nondeterministic behavior.
